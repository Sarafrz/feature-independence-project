# Feature Independence Project

This repository contains notebooks and outputs for studying the effect of linear independence on feature extraction and optimization stability.

## Structure
- **data/** – raw datasets (Iris, WDBC, Boston)
- **notebooks/** – Jupyter notebooks for classification, regression, clustering
- **outputs/** – figures and metric tables

## Goals
- Reduce collinearity among features
- Compare PCA, RFE, SelectKBest
- Evaluate optimization stability and convergence speed
- Apply models such as KNN, KMeans, Linear Regression
